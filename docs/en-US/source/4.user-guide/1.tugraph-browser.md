# TuGraph Browser

> This document focuses on the use of TuGraph Browser.

## 1.Introduction

TuGraph Browser (hereinafter referred to as Browser) is a powerful product visualization development tool that presents graph data in an intuitive visual way, allowing users to easily manage, maintain, and view the database running status. This tool not only supports graph data management and visualization but also supports system account management, providing users with a comprehensive operation and management experience, enabling users to manage and utilize graph databases more efficiently.

## 2.User Guide

### 2.1.Accessing

After the user completes the installation of the graph database, they can access the Browser through a browser. Users only need to enter the IP:Port of the server where TuGraph is located in the browser address bar. The default port used is 7070.

- For example:127.0.0.1:7070.
- Recommend using Chrome.

### 2.2.Logging in

![login](../../../images/browser/login.png)

- After successfully accessing the Browser, the login page appears first (as shown above), where users need to fill in their account and password to log in.
- The database address format: bolt://ip:bolt_port.
- Default account: admin.
- Default password: 73@TuGraph.
- After the user's first login, they will be redirected to the password modification page. Once the password is successfully modified, they can only use the new password to log in.

### 2.3.Quick Start

For first-time users of TuGraph, you can quickly build a graph project with the built-in demo data and get started with graph data projects quickly.

#### 2.3.1.Creating a Graph Project

In the `Graph Project` homepage tab, click `Create New Graph Project` to create a new graph project.

![quickstart-creategraph](../../../images/browser/quickstart-creategraph.png)

Select a built-in demo data, and click the `Next` button.

![quickstart-selectdemo](../../../images/browser/quickstart-selectdemo.png)

In the Fill in Configurations interface, enter the graph project information. Since the demo data is relatively small in size, set the Maximum Storage Space to 1 GB. After entering the graph project information, click the Create button, and the system will automatically create the graph model of the demo data and import the graph data.

![quickstart-configure](../../../images/browser/quickstart-configure.png)

#### 2.3.2.Starting a Graph Project

After creating a graph project with demo data, you can find the corresponding graph project in the `Graph Project` tab, and then click `Graph Query` to query graph data.

![quickstart-graphtab](../../../images/browser/quickstart-graphtab.png)

Execute the default query statement to browse the graph data in the demo.

![quickstart-result](../../../images/browser/quickstart-result.png)

### 2.4.Graph Project

`Graph Project` provides visualized graph project management and graph data development functions, providing users with a series of convenient graph data visualization operations, including graph project creation, modification, deletion, and other management operations, as well as graph data queries, vertex-edge statistics, and other operations. In addition, it also supports graph model management, making it more convenient for users to manage and maintain graph data.

#### 2.4.1.Graph Project Management

On the `Graph Project` page, you can see the graph projects in the current graph database.

![graphmanagement-homepage](../../../images/browser/graphmanagement-homepage.png)

##### 2.4.1.1.Creating a Graph Project

On the `Graph Project` page, click the `Create New Graph Project` button to create a new graph project.

![graphmanagement-creategraph](../../../images/browser/graphmanagement-creategraph.png)

Creating a new graph project requires completing the creation of the graph project through two pages: `Select Template` and `Fill in Configurations`.

- __Select Template__: The product provides two types of templates: empty templates and demo templates.
    - Empty templates: A brand new graph project where users need to create their own graph model and import graph data, generally used for formal project development.
    - Demo templates: Built-in demo data in the product. After the graph project is created successfully, the system will automatically create a demo graph model and import demo graph data, usually used for trial and learning.

![graphmanagement-selecttemplate](../../../images/browser/graphmanagement-selecttemplate.png)

- __Fill in Configurations__: Users need to fill in basic information about the graph project and click the `Create` button to create the graph project.
    - Graph Name: The name of the new graph project, which is also the unique primary key of the graph project. Supports Chinese characters, letters, numbers, and underscores, but does not support spaces or other special characters.
    - Graph Description: The description of the new graph project can be used to describe the background and objectives of the project in detail.
    - Advanced Configuration - Maximum Storage Space: Set the maximum storage space that the graph project can occupy. It does not actually occupy physical storage space in advance. After the actual data volume reaches the maximum storage space threshold, no more data can be written.

![graphmanagement-configure](../../../images/browser/graphmanagement-configure.png)

After creation, the graph project can be viewed in the graph project tab on the `Graph Project` page.

##### 2.4.1.2.Editing a Graph Project

On the `Graph Project` page, click the `Edit button` (pencil icon) in the graph project tab to edit the basic information of the corresponding graph project.

### 2.5.Console

The `Console` provides a visualized account management and database information viewing function. It provides users with comprehensive account and role management functions, including adding, deleting, modifying, and disabling accounts and roles. In addition, it also provides users with convenient database information viewing function, allowing users to easily view the basic information and configuration information of the graph database. Basic information mainly includes version number, running time, CPP compilation version number, etc., while database configuration information includes port number, system function parameter configuration, etc.

- Role Name: supports Chinese, letters, numbers, and underscores, but does not support spaces or other special characters.
- Graph Permissions: The browser supports four types of graph permission configurations: All, Read/Write, Read-Only, and None.
    - All: corresponds to the read and write permissions of the graph, including editing the graph model permissions (schema).
    - Read/Write: corresponds to the write permission of the graph, but does not include the permission to edit the graph model (schema).
    - Read-Only: corresponds to the read permission of the graph.
    - None: cannot access or operate the corresponding graph.
- Role Conflict: When two roles have different graph permissions for the same graph, and both roles are authorized to the same account, the graph permission of the account for the graph is the union of the graph permissions of the two roles.

##### b.Edit Role

- Disabled Role: After the role is disabled, the corresponding graph permissions become invalid.
    - When a user has two roles with operating permissions on the same graph, if one of the roles is disabled, the permission of the other role is still valid.
