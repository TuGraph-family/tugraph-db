## 1.Overview
Python's TuGraph Rpc Client is a CPP Client SDK packaged with pybind11, so its interface details are not detailed in this document. This document only explains the use of TuGraph Python Restful Client SDK, including executing stored procedures, calling Cypher, and other operations.

### 2.1.Call cypher

```python
TuGraphClient import TuGraphClient

client = TuGraphClient("127.0.0.1:7071" , "admin", "73@TuGraph")
cypher = "match (n) return properties(n) limit 1"
res = client.call_cypher(cypher)
print(res)
```

### 2.2.Call stored procedure

```python
TuGraphClient import TuGraphClient

client = TuGraphClient("127.0.0.1:7071" , "admin", "73@TuGraph")
plugin_type = "cpp"
plugin_name = "khop"
plugin_input = "{\"root\": 10, \"hop\": 3}"
res = client.call_plugin(plugin_type, plguin_name, plugin_input)
