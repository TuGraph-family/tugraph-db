# TuGraph Java SDK

## 1.Compile java client code

```shell
cd deps/tugraph-db-client-java
sh local_build.sh
```

## 2.Demo

### 2.1.Instantiate the client object

Introduce dependencies
```java
import com.antgroup.tugraph.TuGraphDbRpcClient;
```

#### 2.1.1.Instantiate a single node client object
When starting the server in single-node mode, the client is instantiated in the following format
```java
TuGraphDbRpcClient client = new TuGraphDbRpcClient("127.0.0.1:19099", "admin", "73@TuGraph");
```
```
public TuGraphDbRpcClient(String url, String user, String pass)
@param url: tugraph host looks like ip:port
@param user: login user name
@param password: login password
```

#### 2.1.2.Instantiate the HA cluster to directly connect to the client object
When the HA cluster deployed on the server can be directly connected using the URL configured in ha_conf, the client is instantiated according to the following format
```java
TuGraphDbRpcClient client = new TuGraphDbRpcClient("127.0.0.1:19099", "admin", "73@TuGraph");
```
```
public TuGraphDbRpcClient(String url, String user, String pass)
@param url: tugraph host looks like ip:port
@param user: login user name
@param password: login password
```
The user only needs to pass in the url of any node in the HA cluster, and the client will automatically maintain the connection pool based on the query information returned by the server, and there is no need to manually restart the client when the HA cluster expands horizontally.

#### 2.1.3.Instantiate the HA cluster to indirectly connect to the client object
When the HA cluster deployed on the server cannot use the URL configured in ha_conf to connect directly but must use an indirect URL (such as the Alibaba Cloud public network URL), the client is instantiated according to the following format.
```java
List<String> urls = new ArrayList<>();
urls.add("189.33.97.23:9091");
urls.add("189.33.97.24:9091");
urls.add("189.33.97.25:9091");
TuGraphDbRpcClient client = new TuGraphDbRpcClient(urls, "admin", "73@TuGraph");
```
```
public TuGraphDbRpcClient(List<String> urls, String user, String password)
@param urls: tugraph host list
@param user: login user name
@param password: login password
```
Because the URL that the user connects to is different from the information configured when the server starts, the client connection pool cannot be automatically updated by sending a request to the cluster, so it is necessary to manually pass in the URLs of all nodes in the cluster when starting the client, and when the cluster node changes Manually restart the client.

### 2.2.Call cypher
```java
    String res = client.callCypher("CALL db.edgeLabels()", "default", 10);
    log.info("db.edgeLabels() : " + res);
```
```
    @param cypher: inquire statement.
    @param graph: the graph to query.
    @param timeout: Maximum execution time, overruns will be interrupted
    @param url: (Optional) Node address of calling cypher
    @return: the result of cypher query execution
    public String callCypher(String cypher, String graph, double timeout, String url)
```
This interface supports use in stand-alone mode and HA mode. Among them, in the client in HA mode, a read request can be directed to a server by specifying the url parameter.
Note: JAVA does not support default parameters, therefore, default parameters in JAVA are implemented using overloaded functions.

### 2.3. Send cypher request to leader
```java
     String res = client.callCypherToLeader("CALL db.edgeLabels()", "default", 10);
     log.info("db.edgeLabels() : " + res);
```
```
     @param cypher: inquire statement.
     @param graph: the graph to query.
     @param timeout: Maximum execution time, overruns will be interrupted
     @return: the result of cypher query execution
     public String callCypherToLeader(String cypher, String graph, double timeout)
```
This interface only supports use in HA mode. In the client in HA mode, in order to prevent requests from being sent to followers with unsynchronized data,
Users can directly send requests to the leader, and the leader is elected by the cluster.

### 2.4. Call GQL
```java
     String res = client.callGql("CALL db.edgeLabels()", "default", 10);
     log.info("db.edgeLabels() : " + res);
```
```
     @param gql: inquire statement.
     @param graph: the graph to query.
     @param timeout: Maximum execution time, overruns will be interrupted
     @param url: (Optional) Node address of calling GQL
     @return: the result of GQL query execution
     public String callGql(String gql, String graph, double timeout, String url)
```
This interface supports use in stand-alone mode and HA mode. Among them, in the client in HA mode, a read request can be directed to a server by specifying the url parameter.
Note: JAVA does not support default parameters, therefore, default parameters in JAVA are implemented using overloaded functions.

### 2.5. Send GQL request to leader
```java
     String res = client.callGqlToLeader("CALL db.edgeLabels()", "default", 10);
     log.info("db.edgeLabels() : " + res);
```
```
     @param gql: inquire statement.
     @param graph: the graph to query.
     @param timeout: Maximum execution time, overruns will be interrupted
     @return: the result of cypher query execution
     public String callGqlToLeader(String cypher, String graph, double timeout)
```
This interface only supports use in HA mode. In the client in HA mode, in order to prevent requests from being sent to followers with unsynchronized data,
Users can directly send requests to the leader, and the leader is elected by the cluster.

### 2.6. Calling stored procedures
```java
     String result = client.callProcedure("CPP", "khop", kHopParamGen(), 1000, false, "default");
     log.info("testCallProcedure : " + result);

             boolean inProcess, String graph, String url)
```
