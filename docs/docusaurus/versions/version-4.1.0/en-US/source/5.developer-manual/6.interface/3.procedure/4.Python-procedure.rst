Introduction
------------------
Similar to SQLite and Neo4j, TuGraph can work in embedded mode. In embedded mode, it works
like a library. You can write your own application and call the library functions to create, query
and modify the graph. In this case, all the data exchange between the application and the graph
database goes in the same process. It is very simple and efficient.

This is the python API document for TuGraph embedded mode. With the embedded API, the user
can open or create a database, and then query or modify the database.
