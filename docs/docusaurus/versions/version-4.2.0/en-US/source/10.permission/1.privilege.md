# Privilege

## 1.Introduce

> The permissions of TuGraph are managed based on role-based access control. The permissions that define access control are assigned to roles, and the roles are then assigned to users.

## 2.Level of permissions

- Global layer: indicates global permissions, which have permissions for management and graph operations.
- Graph layer: control permissions on each graph;
- Property level (Commercial version only) : control permissions on a property

## 3.Permission keyword

At present, the control of permissions is relatively simple

- The Global layer currently has admin permission, and the admin user is preset.

* The Graph layer has four operation permissions: none, read, write, and full

- none: No permission, no operation permission for the graph
- read: Read-only permission, only has read permission for the graph
- write: Read and write permission, not only has read permission for the graph, but also has write permission
- full: All permissions, not only have read and write permissions for graphs, but also have permissions to delete graphs, modify graphs, and modify schemas

* The Property layer (Commercial version only)  has the following permissions: none, read, and write

- none: No permission, no operation permission for the property
- read: Read-only permission, only has read permission for the property
- write: Read and write permission, not only has read permission for the property, but also has write permission

## 4.Common permission operations

### 4.1.User action

- Creating a user

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.createUser(user_name::STRING,password::STRING)
```

- Deleting a user

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.deleteUser(user_name::STRING)
```

- Change the password of the current user

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.changePassword(current_password::STRING,new_password::STRING)
```

- Changes the password of a specified user

```cypher

CALL dbms.security.changeUserPassword(user_name::STRING,new_password::STRING)
```

- Disable or enable a user

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.disableUser(user::STRING,disable::BOOLEAN)
```

- List all users

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.listUsers()
```

- Lists the current user information

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.showCurrentUser()
```

- Obtain user details

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.getUserInfo(user::STRING)
```

### 4.2.Role actions

- Create a role

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.createRole(role_name::STRING,desc::STRING)
```

- Delete a role

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.deleteRole(role_name::STRING
```

- List all characters

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.listRoles()
```

- Disable or enable the role

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.disableRole(role::STRING,disable::BOOLEAN)
```

### 4.3.Assign roles to users

- Adds the association between the user and the role

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.addUserRoles(user::STRING,roles::LIST)
```

- Deletes the association between the user and the role

CALL dbms.security.deleteUserRoles(user::STRING,roles::LIST)

- Clears the relationship between user roles and rebuilds them

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.rebuildUserRoles(user::STRING,roles::LIST)
```

### 4.4.Role empowerment

- Modifies the access permission of a role to a specified graph

```cypher
CALL dbms.security.modSpecifiedAccessLevel(role::STRING,access_level::MAP)
```
