# TuGraph Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the future development plans for TuGraph, including features currently under development, those
not in the development pipeline, and completed functionalities not included in the open-source version.

TuGraph aims to be an open-source, high-performance graph database. It adopts a centralized storage approach for graph
data and, in the short term, does not consider data sharding. Instead, it employs a master-slave replication mode to
address high-concurrency read scenarios, while utilizing cloud-based storage solutions to address storage capacity
challenges.

## 2. Completed Functionalities

TuGraph was open-sourced on September 1, 2022, and has received regular bug fixes and enhancements based on community
feedback.

## 4. Community Collaboration Features

Currently, the development team's resources are limited, and we cannot implement all the desired features for TuGraph.
However, during the feature planning process, we have identified a range of ideas worth exploring. The team has
conducted some initial exploration, and we welcome community collaboration in developing the following features:

| Version	 | Functionality	                                                | Planned Date |
