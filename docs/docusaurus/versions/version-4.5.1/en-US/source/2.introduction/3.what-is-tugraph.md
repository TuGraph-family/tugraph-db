# What is TuGraph

> This document mainly introduces the main features and characteristics of TuGraph Community Edition, as well as the differences between TuGraph Enterprise Edition and Community Edition.


## 1.Introduction

Graph database is a non-relational database that stores data by vertices and edges. It can be used to store complex data network models, such as social networks and transaction networks. TuGraph is a graph database developed by Ant Group. This manual introduces the functions and usage of TuGraph.

## 2.TuGraph Community Edition

The Community Edition is a fully functional version of TuGraph, suitable for single-instance deployment. It provides complete basic fuctions of graph database, such as ACID-compatible transactions, programming APIs, and associated tools. It is ideal for learning TuGraph and implementing small projects.

## 3.TuGraph features

TuGraph is a large-scale graph computing system independently developed by Ant Group, providing graph database engine and graph analysis engine. Its main features are large data storage and computation, high throughput, and flexible API, while supporting efficient online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). LightGraph and GeaGraph are former names of TuGraph.

The main functional features include:

- Labeled property graph model
- Support multiple Graphs
- Full ACID transaction processing
- Built-in 34 graph analysis algorithm
- Graph visualization tool based on Web client
- RESTful API and RPC are supported
- OpenCypher graph query language
- Stored procedure based on C++/Python/Java
- The Traversal API for efficient graph algorithm development

Performance and scalability features include:

- TB large capacity
- High throughput of ten million vertices per second
- High Availability Support (Enterprise Edition)
- High-performance Batch Import
- Online/offline backup

## 4.TuGraph Enterprise Edition

The Enterprise Edition has more comprehensive support for commercial features, including distributed cluster architecture, a one-stop graph platform covering exploration, research and development, service and operation and maintenance throughout the lifecycle, online, near-line, and offline graph computing engines, support for streaming and big data data sources, multi-site and multi-center deployment, making it an ideal choice for commercial solutions.
