# Bolt client

TuGraph implements Neo4j's bolt protocol, you can use Neo4j's client to access TuGraph.

## Enable bolt port

If you are using the TuGraph runtime docker image, the config file is `/usr/local/etc/lgraph.json`.

Add `bolt_port=7687` (modify the port) to TuGraph's config file to enable the bolt port, Neo4j clients should connect to the bolt port.

## Limitations on use

TuGraph does not implement all the features of neo4j bolt protocol.

Explicit transactions are currently not supported and need to avoid using these features.

There are some examples for reference under `demos/Bolt` in the code repository.
