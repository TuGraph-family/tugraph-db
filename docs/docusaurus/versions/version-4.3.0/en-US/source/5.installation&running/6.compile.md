# Compile

> This document mainly describes how to compile TuGraph from source code.

## 1.Prerequisites

It is recommended to build TuGraph on a Linux system. Meanwhile, Docker is a good choice. If you want to set up a new environment, please refer to [Dockerfile](3.docker-deployment.md)。

## 2.compile

Here are steps to compile TuGraph:

1. run `deps/build_deps.sh` to build tugraph-web if you need. Skip this step otherwise.
2. `cmake .. -DOURSYSTEM=centos` or `cmake .. -DOURSYSTEM=ubuntu`
3. If support shell lgraph_cypher, use `-DENABLE_PREDOWNLOAD_DEPENDS_PACKAGE=1`
4. If compiling on an arm machine (such as a Mac with M1 chip), add `-DENABLE_BUILD_ON_AARCH64=ON`
5`make`
6`make package` or `cpack --config CPackConfig.cmake`

Example:
`tugraph/tugraph-compile-centos7`Docker environment

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/TuGraph-family/tugraph-db.git
$ cd tugraph-db
$ deps/build_deps.sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. -DOURSYSTEM=centos -DENABLE_PREDOWNLOAD_DEPENDS_PACKAGE=1
$ make
$ make package
```
