# Introduction

> This document describes the differences between TuGraph Enterprise and TuGraph Community , TuGraph features, and TuGraph version number control.

## What is Graph Database

    Graph database is a non-relational database that stores data by vertices and edges. It can be used to store complex data network models, such as social networks and transaction networks. TuGraph is a graph database developed by Ant Group. This manual introduces the functions and usage of TuGraph.

## TuGraph Community Edition

    The Community Edition is a fully functional version of TuGraph, suitable for single-instance deployment. It provides complete basic fuctions of graph database, such as ACID-compatible transactions, programming APIs, and associated tools. It is ideal for learning TuGraph and implementing small projects.

## TuGraph Enterprise Edition

    The enterprise version extends TuGraph's basic functions. For example, the deployment mode includes high-availability and distributed, the underlying storage engine with faster performance improvement, and the role permission control with finer function improvement. It is ideal for commercial solutions.

## The data model

### Graph model

TuGraph is a strong schema property graph database with multi-graph capability. It supports the construction of directed graphs with up to one trillion vertices.

- Multiple graphs: In TuGraph, each database server can host multiple graph models, each graph model can have its own access control configuration, and the database administrator can create or delete specified graph models.

- Property graph: vertices and edges in TuGraph can have properties associated with them, and each attribute can have a different type.

- Strong schema: Each vertex and edge must have a label, and the number and type of properties are difficult to change after the label created.

- Directed edges: The edges in TuGraph are directed edges. To simulate an undirected edge, the user can create two opposite edges.

### The data type

TuGraph Supports a variety of data types that can be used as attributes, the specific supported data types are as follows：

| FLOAT        |                     |                     | 32-bit float                                     |
| DOUBLE       |                     |                     | 64-bit float                                     |
| STRING       |                     |                     | A string of variable length                      |

_BLOB data is BASE64 encoded in input and output_

### Index

TuGraph supports indexing vertex fields.

Indexes can be unique or non-unique. If a unique index is created for a vertex label, TuGraph will perform a data integrity check to ensure the uniqueness of the index before modifying the vertex of the label.

Each index built on a single field of a label, and multiple fields can be indexed using the same label.

BLOB fields cannot be indexed.
