## Resource preparation for building docker image

The docker files here uses many Cpp library resources which are uploaded to oss service. You can refer
to  https://tugraph-db.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/5.developer-manual/1.installation/3.docker-deployment.html for more
details.

Most of them are the same as the original resource. However, some exceptional ones are carefully
modified to accelerate the building process with these problems:

- Download packages directly from some slow website in CMake files
- Revise the cmake files to make it work

The pacakges revised from the original ones include,

- GraphAr package
- Geometry package

### GraphAr Package

GraphAr has Apache arrow embedded, which downloads lots of 3rd-party packages during the building
process. To accelerate the building process, take these steps:

- Download GraphAr package from github and Apache Arrow package referring to the link inside GraphAr, Eg:
    - Gar package link: https://github.com/alibaba/GraphAr/archive/refs/tags/v0.7.0.tar.gz
    - Arrow package
      link: https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua?action=download&filename=arrow/arrow-${ARROW_VERSION_TO_BUILD}/apache-arrow-${ARROW_VERSION_TO_BUILD}.tar.gz
- Apache Arrow package
    - Upload Apache Arrow package to oss
        - Eg: https://tugraph-web.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/tugraph/deps/graphar/apache-arrow-10.0.1.tar.gz
- GraphAr package
    - Replace the GAR_ARROW_SOURCE_FILE variable with the oss url.
    - Repackage GraphAr and upload it to oss
- Download the third-party packages required by Apache Arrow
    - Script located in `apache-arrow-10.0.1/cpp/thirdparty/download_dependencies.sh`
    - Use the script to download the third-party packages required by Apache Arrow to local
    - Upload the packages to oss and update the Dockerfile Arrow related variable with the oss urls in batch
