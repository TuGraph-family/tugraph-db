B+ trees use a split and merge method to update sorted data in tree nodes, while LSM trees append updates to logs for delayed data merging. B+ trees were originally used in file system implementations, solving the problem of differences in performance between sequential and random operations on hard disks by storing data in adaptive-length leaf nodes, and have a relatively balanced read/write performance. The main advantage of LSM trees is to use WAL (Write Ahead Log) to perform updates, which turns update operations into sequential operations, especially in the case of small key-value pairs. WAL means that the update of data is deferred until it is merged in batches, which can improve the comprehensive efficiency of batch updates, but also makes the system scheduling more complicated. If the update merge is not completed, and the data is read again, LSM trees need to read several levels of locally merged logs, which will cause read amplification and space amplification, thereby affecting read efficiency."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To sum up, B+ trees have better sequential read/write performance, while LSM trees have advantages in random write data.
