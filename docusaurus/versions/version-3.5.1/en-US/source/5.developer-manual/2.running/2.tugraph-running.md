# Tugraph Running

> This document describes the operation mode of the TuGraph service, starting, stopping, and restarting operations.And TuGraph's service configuration parameters, configuration file format, and command-line configuration parameters.

## 1. Prerequisites
TuGraph has the following prerequisites for its execution: a correct [installation of TuGraph](../1.installation/1.environment.md).

TuGraph execution requires ensuring that the library file "liblgraph.so" is located in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The user running the TuGraph process does not need superuser privileges. However, they need read permissions for the configuration file (usually lgraph.json) and any files referenced within it. Additionally, they should have write permissions for data folders, log files, etc.

## 2.The operation mode

TuGraph can be started as a normal process in the foreground or as a daemon in the background.

When running as a normal process, TuGraph can print logs directly to the terminal, which is handy when debugging server configurations. However, because the foreground process is terminated after the terminal exits, the user must ensure that the terminal remains open while the TuGraph server is running. In daemon mode, on the other hand, the TuGraph server can continue to run even if the terminal that started it exits. If TuGraph needs to run for a long time, it is recommended to start the TuGraph server in daemon mode.

### 2.1.Running a normal process

The 'lgraph_server -d run' command runs TuGraph as a normal process. Normal processes depend on the command line terminal, so when the terminal ends, the TuGraph process is automatically terminated. Normal process mode with '--log_dir ""' can output the process log directly to the terminal, so it is easier to debug.

Start the command：

```shell
$ ./lgraph_server -c lgraph_standalone.json --log_dir ""
```

Example of running output in normal mode：

```shell

```

In normal process mode, the user can prematurely terminate the TuGraph process by pressing 'CTRL+C'.

### 2.2.Run process daemon mode

Start the command：

```shell
$ ./lgraph_server -d start -c lgraph_daemon.json
```

Example output from running in daemon mode:

```shell
Starting lgraph...
The service process is started at pid 12109.
```

The TuGraph server process started by this command is a daemon process that loads the relevant configuration from the file 'lgraph_daemon.json'. After the server starts, it will start printing logs in a log file that can then be used to determine the status of the server.

## 3.Service operation

### 3.1.Start the service

TuGraph needs to be started using the 'lgraph_server -d start' command line. The following is an example of the command to start TuGraph:

```bash
$ ./lgraph_server -d start -c lgraph_daemon.json
Starting lgraph...
The service process is started at pid 12109.
```

The TuGraph server process started by this command is a daemon process that loads the relevant configuration from the file 'lgraph_daemon.json'. After the server starts, it will start printing logs in a log file that can then be used to determine the status of the server.

### 3.2.Stop the service

You can stop the TuGraph daemon using the 'kill' command and the 'lgraph_server -d stop' command. Since it is possible to run multiple TuGraph server processes on the same computer, we distinguish between the different server processes using the '.pid 'file, which is written to the working directory where the process was started. Therefore, you need to run the command 'lgraph_server-d stop' in the same working directory to stop the correct server process.

```shell
user@host:~/tugraph$ ./lgraph_server -d start -c lgraph_standalone.json
20200508122306.378: Starting lgraph...
20200508122306.379: The service process is started at pid 93.

user@host:~/tugraph$ cat ./lgraph.pid
93

user@host:~/tugraph$ ./lgraph_server -d stop -c lgraph_standalone.json
20200508122334.857: Stopping lgraph...
20200508122334.857: Process stopped.
```

### 3.3.Restart the service

Users can also restart the TuGraph service by 'lgraph_server -d restart' :

```bash
$ ./lgraph_server -d restart
Stopping lgraph...
Process stopped.
Starting lgraph...
The service process is started at pid 20899.
```

## 4.Service configuration

The TuGraph server loads configurations from the configuration file and command line options at startup, and if different values are specified for the same option in the configuration file and command line, the value specified in the command line will be used preferentially.

### 4.1.Configuration parameters

The parameters and their types are described as follows:

### 4.2.Server configuration file

TuGraph's configuration file is stored in JSON format. It is recommended that most configuration be stored in configuration files and that some configuration parameters be modified only temporarily using command-line options when needed.

A typical configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "directory": "/var/lib/lgraph/data",
  "license": "/var/lib/lgraph/fma.lic",

  "port": 7090,
  "rpc_port": 9090,
  "enable_ha": false,

  "verbose": 1,
  "log_dir": "/var/log/lgraph/",

  "ssl_auth": false,
  "server_key": "/usr/local/etc/lgraph/server-key.pem",
  "server_cert": "/usr/local/etc/lgraph/server-cert.pem"
}
```
