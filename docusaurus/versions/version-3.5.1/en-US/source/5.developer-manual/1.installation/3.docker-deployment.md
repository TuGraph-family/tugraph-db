# Docker Deployment

>This document introduces the creation and download of Docker images for TuGraph Compile and TuGraph Runtime.

## 1.Introduction

- TuGraph Compile Image: Provides a compilation environment and can be used for TuGraph compilation and testing.
- TuGraph Runtime Image: Provides a binary executable environment with TuGraph library and executable files.
- TuGraph Mini Runtime Image: Provides a binary executable environment without Java and Python functions in TuGraph, no C++ plugin compilation and execution, only so upload.

## 2.Existing Docker Images

### 2.1.Image Download

The images are hosted on [DockerHub]( https://hub.docker.com/u/tugraph ) and can be downloaded and used directly.

### 2.2.Naming Convention

#### 2.2.1.TuGraph Compile Image

Provides a compilation environment and can be used for TuGraph compilation.

`tugraph/tugraph-compile-[os name & version]:[tugraph compile version]`

For example: `tugraph/tugraph-compile-centos7:1.2.0`

#### 2.2.2.TuGraph Runtime Image

Provides a binary executable environment with TuGraph library and executable files.

`tugraph/tugraph-runtime-[os name & version]:[tugraph-runtime version]`

For example:`tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:3.4.0`

#### 2.2.3.TuGraph Mini Runtime Image

Provides a binary executable environment without Java and Python functions in TuGraph, no C++ plugin compilation and execution, only so upload.

`tugraph/tugraph-mini-runtime-[os name & version]:[tugraph-runtime version]`

For example: `tugraph/tugraph-mini-runtime-centos7:3.4.0`

## 2.3.Common Docker Operations

Docker is generated from Dockerfile. Note that creating images requires downloading dependencies, so network issues may cause slow creation or creation failure. Do not overwrite images unless the tag is `latest`.

build Compile image
```bash
docker build -f tugraph-compile-centos7-Dockerfile -t tugraph/tugraph-compile-centos7:1.2.0 .
```

build Runtime / Mini Runtime image
```bash
docker build --build-arg FILEPATH="${rpm_path_in_oss}" --build-arg FILENAME="${rpm_name}" -f tugraph-compile-centos7-Dockerfile -t tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:1.2.0 .
```

Modify image name
```bash
docker tag ${image_name}:${image_tag} tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:3.3.0
```

push image
```bash
docker push tugraph/tugraph-compile-centos7:1.2.0 .
```

pull image
```bash
docker pull tugraph/tugraph-compile-centos7:1.2.0
```

save image
```bash
docker save ${image_name}:${image_tag} | gzip > lgraph_latest.tar.gz
```

load image
```bash
docker load --input lgraph_latest.tar.gz
```

Refer to the [docker official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli ) for other Docker operations.
