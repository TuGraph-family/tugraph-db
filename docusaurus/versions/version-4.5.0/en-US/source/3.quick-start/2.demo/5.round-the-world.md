# Demo:Round The World

> This document mainly introduces the usage of the round-the-world demo.

## Brief

Based on the virtual background of "Around the World in 80 Days" and partial public historical flight data, it helps users design optimal flight plans for multiple cities.
- Demo designed custom website service
- The data source is a foreign open source website and does not include mainland city flight data
- The flight prices in the data are simulated data and do not represent real prices.
