# Introduction to ISO GQL

Graph Query Language (GQL) is an upcoming International Standard language for property graph querying. It builds on the foundations of SQL and integrates proven ideas from the existing [openCypher, PGQL, GSQL, and G-CORE](https://gql.today/comparing-cypher-pgql-and-g-core/) languages. The standard is currently in the draft stage.

TuGraph has implemented GQL based on the [ISO GQL (ISO/IEC 39075) Antlr4 grammar file](https://github.com/TuGraph-family/gql-grammar). It includes some extensions and modifications. Not all GQL syntax is fully supported at the moment, but we will continue to improve and enhance it in the future.
