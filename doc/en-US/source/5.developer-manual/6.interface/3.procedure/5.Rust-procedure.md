# Rust Procedure

## Introduction
Similar to C++ stored procedure (Legacy version), TuGraph can support any language compiled into dynamic library as plugin. Rust, as a new rising star in system programming language, has great advantages in safety, reliability and ergonomics compared with C++.
We provide [Rust binding] library of TuGraph to support calling lgrahp api in Rust, and provide [tugraph-plugin-util] tool library to help you write Rust plugin code more concisely.

[tugraph-plugin-util]: https://crates.io/crates/tugraph-plugin-util

## One-stop tutorial
We provide a one-stop plugin writing tutorial using Visual Studio Code editor and Dev Container plugin. In the tutorial, you can learn how to use Rust to write plugins and run them in Web interface. For details, please refer to [rust-tugraph-plugin-tutorial].
In addition, the dynamic library so built in the tutorial can also be uploaded and used as stored procedure through RESTful API according to [How to use stored procedures].

## API document
As the Rust community habit, all the code and documents can be found from [`crates.io`] and [`docs.rs`], and we put the direct [link](https://docs.rs/tugraph/latest/tugraph/) here.
