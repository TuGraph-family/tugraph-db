## Basic algorithms

### Breadth-First Search

Breadth first Search implements the Breadth-first Search algorithm, which starts from the root vertex and traverses all accessible vertices along the width of the graph. Returns the number of vertices traversed. Please refer to the algorithm content[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search "bfs wiki")。

### Pagerank

The higher the PageRank value, the higher the importance of the vertex in the graph. The reciprocal of the number of vertices is used as the initial Rank value of each vertex, and then the Rank value of the vertices is transferred to the adjacent vertices on average according to the outgoing edges, and the transfer process is repeated until the given convergence threshold is met or the given number of iterations is reached. At the end of each pass round, a certain proportion of the Rank values of all vertices will be randomly transferred to any vertex. Please refer to the algorithm content [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank "pagerank wiki")。
