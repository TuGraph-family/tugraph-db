# Service configuration

> This document describes TuGraph's service configuration parameters, configuration file formats, and command line configuration parameters

The TuGraph server loads configurations from the configuration file and command line options at startup, and if different values are specified for the same option in the configuration file and command line, the value specified in the command line will be used preferentially.

## Configuration parameters

The parameters and their types are described as follows:

| **Parameter names**           | **<nobr>Type</nobr>** | **Instructions**                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Server configuration file

TuGraph's configuration file is stored in JSON format. It is recommended that most configuration be stored in configuration files and that some configuration parameters be modified only temporarily using command-line options when needed.

A typical configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "directory": "/var/lib/lgraph/data",
  "license": "/var/lib/lgraph/fma.lic",

  "port": 7090,
  "rpc_port": 9090,
  "enable_ha": false,

  "verbose": 1,
  "log_dir": "/var/log/lgraph/",

  "ssl_auth": false,
  "server_key": "/usr/local/etc/lgraph/server-key.pem",
  "server_cert": "/usr/local/etc/lgraph/server-cert.pem"
}
```
