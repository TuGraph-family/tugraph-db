"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Ant Group.

“您”（或“您的”）系指与蚂蚁集团签署本协议的著作权人或经著作权人授权的法律实体。对于法律实体而言，提交贡献内容的实体以及其他任何控制该实体、受其控制或与其受到同一主体控制的实体被视为单个贡献者。为本定义之目的，“控制” 系指（i）通过合同或其他方式，直接或间接对该实体进行指导和管理的权力，（ii）持有该实体百分之五十（50%）或更多的已发行股份，或（iii）间接持有该实体权益。

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Ant Group for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products or projects owned or managed by Ant Group (the "Work"), including without limitation any Work described in Schedule B. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic or written communication sent to Ant Group or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Ant Group for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work.

“贡献内容”系指由您有意地向蚂蚁集团提交，以便被包含或记载在任何蚂蚁集团拥有或管理的产品或项目（“作品”，包括但不限于任何在附录B中列举的作品）中的任何原创作品，包括对既存作品的任何修改和增加。为本定义之目的，“提交”系指向蚂蚁集团或其代表进行的任何形式的电子或书面交流，包括但不限于为讨论和改善作品为目的，通过蚂蚁集团管理的（或以蚂蚁集团名义管理的）电子邮件列表、源代码控制系统和问题跟踪系统进行的交流。

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Ant Group and to recipients of documentation and software distributed by Ant Group a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
