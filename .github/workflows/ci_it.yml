# Issues TODO:
# 1. Seems GitHub limits the output passed among jobs up to 1MB,
#    so we can't break down the entire workflow to multi-jobs.
# 2. For submodules in the repo inside the single job, the git binary in docker image
#    should be upgrade to at least 2.18 in order to use actions/checkout@v3
#    inside docker instead of running ut and it via Dockerfile.
